Telecom Customer Churn Analysis IS An end-to-end data analytics project identifying key drivers of customer attrition. Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), usage pattern segmentation, correlation studies, and predictive modeling (Logistic Regression) to improve customer retention and lifetime value.
In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project analyzes a dataset of customer usage patterns (call minutes, charges, service plans) to identify why customers leave (churn) and how to proactively prevent it.

Advanced Analytics & ModelingClustering (K-Means/Segmentation): The data shows results from a clustering analysis where customers are grouped into four clusters (0 to 3). Each cluster has a profile based on usage (Day, Evening, Night, Intl) and an associated churn rate.Risk Tiering: A risk-scoring analysis that classifies customers into Low, Medium, and High Risk tiers.
High Risk customers (those with a high score range, likely related to service calls) show a churn rate of 45.74\%.
Cluster Profiles: A second clustering table details the proportion of plan types (International/Voice Mail) and average service calls per segment.
